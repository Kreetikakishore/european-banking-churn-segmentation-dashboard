## 📌 Executive Summary

Customer churn remains one of the most expensive hidden losses for retail banks, directly impacting deposits, product profitability, and long-term customer lifetime value.

This project analyzes **10,000 European banking customers** across France, Germany, and Spain to uncover:

- Where churn risk is geographically concentrated
- Which customer demographics are most vulnerable
- How inactivity and product overload influence exits
- How much customer balance is financially exposed

Using Python, Pandas, Plotly, and Streamlit, the final outcome is an interactive churn segmentation dashboard built to support retention-focused decision making.

---

## 🎯 Business Questions Addressed

- Which geography shows the highest customer attrition risk?
- Which age bands are most likely to leave the bank?
- Are premium high-balance customers churning disproportionately?
- Does inactive membership strongly correlate with exits?
- Is product over-selling contributing to churn?
- Which demographic combinations require urgent retention intervention?
- How much total customer balance is at risk due to churn?

## 📊 Core KPI Snapshot

| KPI Metric | Value |
|------------|-------|
| Total Customers Analyzed | 10,000 |
| Overall Churn Rate | 20.37% |
| Highest Risk Geography | Germany |
| Highest Risk Age Group | 46–60 Years |
| High Value Customer Churn | 25.23% |
| Estimated Balance at Risk | €159.4 Million |
| Inactive vs Active Churn Gap | 12.58% |

## 🧠 Key Analytical Findings

### 1. Germany Emerges as the Highest Churn Geography
Germany records the highest attrition rate among all three countries, indicating concentrated retention weakness within this customer market.

### 2. Mid-to-Senior Customers Are Most Vulnerable
Customers aged 46–60 show the highest churn propensity, signaling dissatisfaction among financially mature account holders.

### 3. Product Overload Is Linked to Customer Exit
Customers holding 3 to 4 banking products exhibit extreme churn percentages, suggesting that aggressive cross-selling may be increasing account fatigue rather than loyalty.

### 4. Inactive Members Show Significantly Higher Churn
Inactive customers churn at nearly 1.9× the rate of active members, confirming engagement inactivity as a major warning indicator.

### 5. High Balance Accounts Represent Significant Financial Exposure
More than €159 million in deposits are attached to churn-prone customers, making retention not just a customer issue but a direct balance sheet concern.

## 📈 Strategic Retention Recommendations

- **Launch dedicated retention campaigns in Germany**, where attrition concentration is highest.
- **Introduce re-engagement programs** for inactive account holders before silent churn occurs.
- **Re-evaluate cross-sell strategies** for customers with multiple products to reduce service fatigue.
- **Prioritize premium high-balance customer outreach**, as they represent the largest financial exposure.
- **Design age-personalized loyalty interventions** for the 46–60 customer band.
